# BeachBot

**"A bot to generate surf reports using meteo data."**

This bot scrapes meteorological data and uses a language model to generate tailored reports. It then sends these reports via email.
It's designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for adaptation to different types of meteorological information beyond just surf conditions.

## Configuration

The core behavior and the type of report generated by BeachBot are controlled by the `bot_config.json` file. This JSON file uses the station numbers as its top-level keys.

By modifying this configuration file, you can:

* **Define multiple locations:** Each top-level key in the JSON corresponds to a specific meteorological station (e.g., a Windguru station number).
    You can add or remove these keys to configure reports for different locations.
    The **only strictly required key** to fetch data is the one representing the station number itself (like `"500968"` in the example), which should correspond to a valid data source identifier (e.g., a Windguru station ID).
* **Customize report details per station:** The value associated with each station number key is an object containing the specific configuration for that location. This includes:
    * Defining local information relevant to the report (`local_beach_info` in the surf example).
    * Setting detailed instructions and formatting requirements for the language model (`prompt_details`).
    * Specifying any thresholds or specific conditions relevant to that location and report type.
* Adapt the input data requirements based on what information is available from the data source for the specific report type you want to generate.

By adding new station number keys and defining their corresponding configuration objects, you can easily extend the bot's capability to generate various kinds of meteorological reports for different locations based on the available data and your defined criteria.


## Prerequisites

Before running BeachBot, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.7+:** You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **pip:** Python package installer (usually included with Python installations).
* **Git:** For managing the repository and its submodule.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository with submodules:**
    When cloning the BeachBot repository, you need to initialize and update its submodules. Use the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules <repository_url>
    cd BeachBot
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository)*

    If you have already cloned the repository without the `--recurse-submodules` option, you can initialize and update the submodules using these commands:
    ```bash
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the BeachBot project and install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary Python packages, including `pathlib`, `python-dotenv`, and any libraries used by `SurfReportService`, `EmailSender`, and the submodule)*

## Environment Variables

BeachBot relies on environment variables for configuration. You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following information:

```dotenv
STATION_NUMBER=<identifier_for_the_weather_station>
SMTPSERVER=<your_smtp_server_address>
SMTPORT=<your_smtp_server_port>
SENDEREMAIL=<your_email_address_for_sending_reports>
RECEIVEREMAIL=<the_email_address_to_send_reports_to>
EMAILPASSWORD=<your_email_password>
OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=<your_OpenRouter_API_key>
BROWSER="chrome"
MODEL="meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free"


Explanation of the environment variables:

    STATION_NUMBER: An identifier (e.g., a number or code) that specifies the particular weather station or data point you are interested in.
    SMTPSERVER: The address of your SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. This is required if you intend to send the generated surf reports via email. Examples include smtp.gmail.com, smtp.office365.com, etc.
    SMTPORT: The port number used by your SMTP server. Common ports are 587 (for TLS/STARTTLS) or 465 (for SSL).
    SENDEREMAIL: The email address that the bot will use to send the surf reports.
    RECEIVEREMAIL: The email address(es) where the generated surf reports should be sent. You can use the same address as SENDEREMAIL if you want to receive them yourself.
    EMAILPASSWORD: The password for the SENDEREMAIL account. Be cautious about storing sensitive information like passwords directly in files.
    OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY: Your API key for accessing the OpenRouter service. You can obtain an API key from the OpenRouter website.
    BROWSER: Specifies the browser to use for web scraping. Currently set to chrome. Ensure the corresponding browser is installed and ChromeDriver (if Chrome is used) is correctly set up.
    MODEL: Specifies the OpenRouter model to use for language processing tasks. Currently set to openrouter/quasar-alpha.

## Running the Bot

To execute the BeachBot and generate a surf report, run the main script with the -m flag (otherwise you will have relative import error):

python -m sources.beachbot.main

**Important Note:** Currently, the `bot_config.json` is set up for a single station number (`500968` - Plage du MÃ©tro).
To use this project for different surf spots or modify its reporting capabilities:
    you must edit the `bot_config.json` file to add new station configurations or modify existing ones according to your needs.

## Debugging
this is the config for vs code:
        {
            "name": "Run BeachBot Module",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "sources.beachbot.main",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "justMyCode": true,
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
        }
